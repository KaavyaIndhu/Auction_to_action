BACKEND CHANGES DOCUMENTATION
============================

Date: Current Session
Purpose: Admin Login Integration and Team Authentication Fixes

CHANGES MADE:
============

1. File: Backend/controllers/authController.js
   - Location: loginTeam function (line ~70)
   - Change: Updated password comparison to use bcrypt.compare()
   - Reason: Team passwords are hashed in the database using bcrypt, but the login was comparing plain text
   - Impact: Fixes team login functionality for all teams with hashed passwords
   - Code Change: 
     OLD: if (team && team.password === password)
     NEW: if (team && (await bcrypt.compare(password, team.password)))

2. File: Backend/controllers/adminController.js
   - Location: getBidHistory function (line ~230)
   - Change: Added round filtering support via query parameters
   - Reason: Frontend needs to filter bid history by specific rounds (Round 1, Round 2, etc.)
   - Impact: Allows admin dashboard to show round-specific bid history
   - Code Change:
     OLD: const history = await BidHistory.find({}).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
     NEW: Added round query parameter filtering with parseInt(round) validation

3. File: Backend/controllers/adminController.js
   - Location: New functions updateBidHistory and deleteBidHistory
   - Change: Added CRUD operations for bid history management
   - Reason: Admin dashboard needs to edit and delete bid history entries
   - Impact: Enables full CRUD functionality for bid history in admin panel
   - Code Change: Added PUT /api/admin/bid-history/:id and DELETE /api/admin/bid-history/:id endpoints

4. File: Backend/routes/adminRoutes.js
   - Location: History routes section
   - Change: Added PUT and DELETE routes for bid history
   - Reason: Support update and delete operations from frontend
   - Impact: Complete CRUD API for bid history management
   - Code Change: Added router.put('/bid-history/:id') and router.delete('/bid-history/:id')

VERIFICATION:
============
- Team login now works with hashed passwords (pattern: REG### discovered via seed.js)
- Admin login uses 'adminToken' consistently across frontend
- All API calls in admin dashboard and team management use proper authentication headers

NO OTHER BACKEND CHANGES WERE REQUIRED:
======================================
- Admin login endpoint was already working correctly
- Token generation and validation were already proper
- All other authentication flows were already implemented correctly

FRONTEND CHANGES (for reference):
================================
- All admin components now use 'adminToken' consistently
- LoginComponent.Admin.jsx stores token as 'adminToken'
- Dashboard.Admin.jsx uses 'adminToken' for API calls
- TeamTable.Admin.jsx uses 'adminToken' for CRUD operations
- adminSocket.js service updated to include admin token in all API calls
- All authentication headers use Bearer token format

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================
1. Test admin login with valid credentials
2. Test team login with pattern REG### (e.g., REG001, REG002, etc.)
3. Verify all admin dashboard features work with authentication
4. Confirm real-time updates work with proper token validation
